I have designed and implemented a simple database
that will allow users to keep track of their customers, and all the information that
they know about them. 
I have also constructed a smiple interface around this databse, and
from this interface, users will have the ability to read a database file from the
disk, add customers, delete customers, and save the database back to the file.
